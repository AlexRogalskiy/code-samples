# Saga implementation example

This is an example on how to implement a Saga. This use case is implemented in the [ProcessOrderSaga](io/axoniq/dev/samples/saga/ProcessOrderSaga.java io/axoniq/dev/samples/saga/ProcessOrderSaga.java)

A webshop has different bounded contexts, for instance, a checkout (where the customer can add items to the card), an order, a shipment, a payment context. The checkout context will produce events based on actions that the customer does in the checkout. Some of these events are the so-called domain events. These events could trigger actions within other contexts. An example could be the [OrderConfirmedEvent](io/axoniq/dev/samples/order/api/OrderConfirmedEvent.java). When an order is confirmed, the order processing starts: the customer should pay, and the ordered articles need shipping. This process needs to be managed. When the order is not paid you need to take some compensating actions like cancelling the shipment.

A Saga is responsible for the process between multiple bounded contexts. The Saga starts on the [OrderConfirmedEvent](io/axoniq/dev/samples/order/api/OrderConfirmedEvent.java) which marks the start of the order process and contains the `orderId`.

An essential aspect of a Saga that is it needs to have an end. An everyday use case is to end a Saga after a certain amount of time. This is why a deadline is set in the first event handler of this Saga. This deadline is handled in the method marked with `@DeadlineHandler`.

Sagaâ€™s are serialized and stored into the database, but the CommandGateway should not be serialized the CommandGateway because of the large dependency tree. You can prevent the CommandGateway from being serialized by adding the transient keyword to de definition. If you forget to do so Axon will throw an exception.

The event-handling methods are annotated with `@SagaEventHandler`. The `@StartSaga` annotation will instantiate a new Saga on every `OrderConfirmedEvent` with a unique orderId. The association property on the `SagaEventHandler` annotation is mandatory and associates the Saga with the `orderId` on the OrderConfirmedEvent. Other ids like the `shipmentId` and the `paymentId` are added using the SagaLifeCycle.associateWith() method. The event handlers will be invoked for events with the same id.

## Saga test example

For testing a fixture test ([ProcessOrderSagaTest](io/axoniq/dev/samples/saga/ProcessOrderSagaTest.java)) can be used. This is a convenient method to implement the tests. 
Just define the test subject:  
`private SagaTestFixture<ProcessOrderSaga> testFixture = new SagaTestFixture<>(ProcessOrderSaga.class);`
Inject the resources needed for your Saga (Don't inject Axon resources since they are already injected) : 
`testFixture.registerResource(uuidProviderMock);`

And implement any given-when-then style test.
